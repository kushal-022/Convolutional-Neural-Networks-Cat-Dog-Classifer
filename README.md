## üêæ About

This Cat Dog Recognition System is a deep learning model that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images of cats and dogs. With a high accuracy of over 95%, this model can be used in various applications, including pet recognition systems and animal behavior studies.

The model was trained on a dataset of over 25,000 images of cats and dogs, with a balanced distribution of both classes. It consists of several convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers and a softmax activation function for classification.

## üöÄ Installation

To use this Cat Dog Recognition System, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/your_username/cat-dog-recognition.git`.
2. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Download the pre-trained weights file from `https://drive.google.com/file/d/your_file_id/view` and place it in the `models` directory.

## üìà Usage

To use the Cat Dog Recognition System, follow these steps:

1. Open the `predict.py` file in your text editor.
2. Update the `image_path` variable with the path to your cat or dog image.
3. Run the `predict.py` file using `python predict.py`.
4. The system will output the predicted class for your image (either "Cat" or "Dog") along with the probability score.

```bash
$ python predict.py
The image is a cat with probability 0.987.
